    <h2>This stress relief website was built in the middle of a 16 week Full Stack Developer bootcamp, when much stress was had, and much relief was needed. If even one modicum of stress slips off of you while at our website, then it was worth the effort. We hope you find the relaxation that you need, and remember to take care of yourself.</h2>
